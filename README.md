# scanner
This is intended to be a replacement scanner for the ToS/SP/LSP teams. The final product will have:
1. Quick
2. Standalone (expanded)
3. Options to make scans verbose (to cut down on time spent examining files after the fact)
4. md5sum checks
5. Tools to locate hacked email accounts and scripts sending mail based upon data from exim
6. Tools to interact with exim and clear the queue. 
7. The ability to change the scans run based upon username and hostname. (ex., on vps root will scan all homes)

The purpose of this project is to make the existing scans more effective, less resource exhaustive, and easier for new techs to run. Once completed we will submit the final product to admins for approval to be used in all hosting environments.
